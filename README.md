# runtastic-js

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/terhuerne/runtastic-js.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/terhuerne/runtastic-js)

runtastic-js is an API-Wrapper for the Runtastic.com Service. The module is designed for use with Node.js and is installable via npm.

##Install
To install runtastic-js you just have to enter this command to your console
`npm install runtastic-js`

##Quickstart
If you just want to start over really quickly, all you need are 5 lines of code:

```js
var runtastic = require('runtastic-js'),
	runtasticApi = new runtastic(RUNTASTIC_E-MAIL-ADRESS, RUNTASTIC_PASSWORD);
	
runtasticApi.login(function(err, user) {
	// Do your Actions here and don't forget to call runtasticApi.logout() when you're finished!
});
```

##API-Reference
This module offers multiple functions to interact with the Runtastic-API. Most of the functions needs to be called after you have called the ```.login()``` method.

###Callable Methods
- [.login(callback(err, user))](#login)
- [.fetchActivities(count, timeframe, callback(err, activities))](#activities)
- [.fetchActivityDetails(id, fetchTraces, callback(err, activity))](#activitydetails)
- [.fetchWeight(count, timeframe, callback(err, weights))](#weight)
- [.fetchHeartrate(count, timeframe, callback(err, heartrates))](#heartrate)
- [.fetchAll(count, timeframe, callback(err, results))](#all)
- [.creatGPXContent(activityDetails, callback(err, gpxContent))](#gpxContent)
- [.logout(callback(err, status))](#logout)

<a name="login"></a>
####.login(callback(err, user))###
Needs to be called before any further interaction with the Runtastic-API. Returns a User-Object when successful or an error.

<a name="activities"></a>
####.fetchActivities(count, timeframe, callback(err, activities))####
Can be called to get the IDs of the activities a User did. 

Variable|Acceptable Types|Behavior

The Object contains of Arrays with two keys. The first key holds the Activity-ID and the second one the UNIX-Timestamp for the Actvitiy.

#####Example#####
```js
// Return the last 10 Activity-Ids between 2016/01/01 and today.
